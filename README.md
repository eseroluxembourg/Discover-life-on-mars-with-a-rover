# Discover-life-on-mars-with-a-rover

We use robots in space. Robotic cars, for example, go on missions to Mars; we call them Mars rovers, 
and they have names like Opportunity and Curiosity. 
A Mars rover must move itself and send information about Mars to Earth. 

But how does it know exactly what to do? A programmer writes a series of steps that the robot 
performs in sequence. For example, the Mars rover performs steps such as "deploy the solar panels", 
"deploy the wheels", "turn on the camera" after it has landed safely on Mars.  
The question is: how do you control a rover a hundred million kilometres away, driving on Mars? As 
we are not on site, it will be controlled from the Earth. A radio signal sent from Earth to Mars takes 
between four and twenty minutes, depending on the position of the Earth in relation to Mars. 
A remotely controlled Mars rover would therefore be piloted with a considerable time lag. An 
example of a direct problem that results from this is that, due to the time lag, it would not be 
possible to brake quickly enough if the rover encounters an obstacle.  

It is therefore necessary to programme the Mars rover in advance so that it can operate 
autonomously and automatically as much as possible. 
In this lesson, students program their own Mars rover in the Scratch programming environment. A 
satellite map of Mars will be laid out on the ground and their rover will have to complete a mission to 
find life on Mars.
